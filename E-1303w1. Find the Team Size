|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |

Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |

Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.*/


select e.employee_id, (select count(team_id) from Employee where e.team_id = team_id) as team_size
from Employee e

OR

SELECT employee_id, COUNT(team_id) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id) team_size
FROM Employee

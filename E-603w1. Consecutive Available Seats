/*Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
#consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table

# SELECT seat_id 
# FROM cinema 
# WHERE free = 1 

#find next seat_id's free = 1 , next seat_id - seat_id = 1


# select distinct a.seat_id
# from cinema a
# join cinema b
# on abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
# and a.free=true and b.free=true
# order by a.seat_id;

 select distinct a.seat_id
 from cinema a, cinema b
 where a.free = 1 and b.free = 1 and
 (a.seat_id+1 = b.seat_id or a.seat_id = b.seat_id+1)
 order by a.seat_id asc

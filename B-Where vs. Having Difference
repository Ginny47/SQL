WHERE clause is used to 'filter' records with a specified condition.

Ex) SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).
However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

Ex) SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

Operators in WHERE clause
= equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal
<= lesser than or equal
<> not equal 
BETWEEN between certain range
LIKE search for a pattern
IN to specify multiple possible values for a column

----------------------------------------------------------
HAVING clause is used to 'aggregate' functions.

Ex) SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

Ex) SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;

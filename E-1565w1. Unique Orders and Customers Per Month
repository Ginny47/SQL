Result table:
+---------+-------------+----------------+
| month   | order_count | customer_count |
+---------+-------------+----------------+
| 2020-09 | 2           | 2              |
| 2020-10 | 1           | 1              |

+---------+-------------+----------------+
In September 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers with invoices > $20.
In October 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer, and only one of the two orders has invoice > $20.
In November 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers but invoices < $20, so we don't include that month.
In December 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer both with invoices > $20.
In January 2021 we have two orders from 2 different customers, but only one of them with invoice > $20.*/

# Write your MySQL query statement below
#SELECT the number of unique orders and 
#SELECT the number of unique customers 
#WHERE with invoices > $20 
#condition for each different month.

#what result table should look like:
#month #of unique orders #of unique customers

SELECT LEFT(order_date, 7) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_count, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM Orders
WHERE invoice >20
GROUP BY month
